<strong>ABOUT ME</strong>
<p font-size="40px">Hey! I'm <strong>Angi</strong>. I own my own hospitality company, but I'm no longer happy doing what I've been doing. So, after working in the hospitality industry for nearly <em>20 yrs</em>, I'm looking for a change. I hope coding will be that change! I am using <strong>SoloLearn</strong>, along with <strong>Codecademy</strong>, <strong>freeCodeCamp</strong> and several other sites to learn, practice, and improve my skills. Feel free to join me on my journey, and please leave <strong>constructive</strong> feedback.</p>
